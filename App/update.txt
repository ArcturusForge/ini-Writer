[u][center]ini-Writer v2.0.0[/center][/u]

[u]Automatic Extension / Resource Importer:[/u][indent]
Don't worry about install instructions for extensions or resources any longer. 
All you need to do now is drag the zip file onto an open ini-Writer window and the app will do the rest.

[u]ini File Drag & Drop Loader:[/u][indent]
If you can't be bothered locating your ini file through the built-in file browser there is now another way!
Simply drag & drop your ini file onto an open ini-Writer window and your file will be loaded so you can get back to modding.

[u]Extension Resource Packs:[/u][indent]
Besides extensions you can now create resource packs that other devs can use for their own extensions without the need to make everything from scratch!
Resources allow for unified assets between multiple extensions that streamlines making extension updates since one change will proliferate to anything that uses it.
So if you can do ui but can't code then now you too can contribute in your own way!
[/indent]

[u]Expanded Window Titles:[/u][indent]
When writing ini files you may forget what extension you are currently using.
Good news, the app will now display the extension name alongside the session name in the title bar.
As an added bonus there is now a working 'Save changes' tag that will also be displayed to help you keep track of what work you've saved.
[/indent]

[u]Game Focused Extension Separation:[/u][indent]
As additional extensions have been created my eyes were opened and I noticed a need for separating extensions rather than having a massive blob of them.
Now in the extension selector panel, extensions will be grouped by which game they belong to.
This is a future-focused change mainly oriented around QoL user experience.
[/indent]

[u]App Changes Panel:[/u][indent]
Some features would go unnoticed without this panel, Hence its creation.
Be up-to-date with what ini-Writer has to offer and never miss out on a new feature again.
