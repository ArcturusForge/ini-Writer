[u][center]ini-Writer v2.0.0[/center][/u]

[u]Automatic Extension Importer:[/u]
[indent]Don't worry about install instructions for extensions any longer. 
All you need to do now is drag the extension zip file onto an open ini-Writer window and the app will do the rest.[/indent]

[u]ini File Drag & Drop Loader:[/u]
[indent]If you can't be bothered locating your ini file through the built-in file browser there is now another way.
Simply drag & drop your ini file onto an open ini-Writer window and your file will be loaded so you can get back to modding.[/indent]

[u]Expanded Window Titles:[/u]
[indent]When writing ini files you may forget what extension you are currently using.
Good news, the app will now display the extension name alongside the session name in the title bar.
As an added bonus there is now a working 'Save changes' tag that will also be displayed to help you keep track of what work you've saved.[/indent]

[u]Game Focused Extension Separation:[/u]
[indent]As additional extensions have been created my eyes were opened and I noticed a need for separating extensions rather than having a massive blob of them.
Now in the extension selector panel, extensions will be grouped by which game they belong to.
This is a future-focused change mainly oriented around QoL user experience.[/indent]

[u]App Changes Panel:[/u]
[indent]Some features would go unnoticed without this panel, Hence its creation.
Be up-to-date with what ini-Writer has to offer and never miss out on a new feature again.[/indent]
