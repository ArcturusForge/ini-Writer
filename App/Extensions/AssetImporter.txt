External Folder where extensions are locally imorted and developed.

Extensions are installed into the %AppData% app directory.
They are then automatically imported into the local App folder by the system.
This allows plugins/extensions to be fully compatible and eliminates the issue presented by .tscn files refering through file-path to used assets-
and being unable to locate them because the filepaths do not match.
